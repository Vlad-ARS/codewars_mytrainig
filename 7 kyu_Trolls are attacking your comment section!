The Task:
Trolls are attacking your comment section!
A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

Test methods:
import codewars_test as test
from solution import disemvowel
@test.describe("Fixed Tests")
def basic_tests():
    @test.it("First fixed test")
    def fixed_test_1():
        test.assert_equals(disemvowel("This website is for losers LOL!"), "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!", 'Incorrect answer for input="This website is for losers LOL!"\n')
    @test.it("Second fixed test")
    def fixed_test_2():
        test.assert_equals(disemvowel("No offense but,\nYour writing is among the worst I've ever read"), "N ffns bt,\nYr wrtng s mng th wrst 'v vr rd", 'Incorrect answer for input="No offense but,\nYour writing is among the worst I\'ve ever read"\n')
    @test.it("Third fixed test")
    def fixed_test_3():
        test.assert_equals(disemvowel("What are you, a communist?"), "Wht r y,  cmmnst?", 'Incorrect answer for input="What are you, a communist?"\n')

MY solution (incorrect):
def disemvowel(string_):
    return "".join([ch for ch in string if ch not in "aeiouAEIOU"])
