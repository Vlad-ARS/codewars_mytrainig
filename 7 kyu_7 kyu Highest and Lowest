TASK:

In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.
Examples
high_and_low("1 2 3 4 5") # return "5 1"
high_and_low("1 2 -3 4 5") # return "5 -3"
high_and_low("1 9 3 4 -5") # return "9 -5"



MY_SOLUTION:
def high_and_low(numbers):
    list_num = numbers.split()
    return f'{max([int(i) for i in list_num])} {min([int(i) for i in list_num])}'
